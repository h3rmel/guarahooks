description: A collection of type-safe, reusable, and customizable hooks to build your applications faster.
---

guarahooks is an open-source collection of custom React hooks focused on performance, type safety, and reusability. It offers hooks for many common use cases.

## How does it work?

Each hook is stored as a JSON file that follows the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) schema. This lets you use the hooks with the Shadcn UI CLI or the [Guara CLI](./docs/cli) if you prefer not to install shadcn/ui's CLI. When you need a hook, simply choose one and copy it into your project using the CLI or manually.

## Why use this collection?

Using this collection lets you:

- Reduce the code you need to write
- Spend less time writing hooks
- Spend less time debugging hooks
- Spend less time reading documentation
- Spend less time searching for hooks

Most importantly, you can **focus on building your application faster!**

## Key Features

- Reusability: guarahooks is designed for reuse, letting you apply the same hook in multiple ways.
- Type safety: catch errors at compile time.
- Performance: optimized for fast, efficient execution.
- Documentation: simple, comprehensive docs with examples.
