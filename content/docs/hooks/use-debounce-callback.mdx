## Props

| Prop       | Type        | Default     | Description                                                |
| ---------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `delay`    | `number`    | `500`       | The delay in milliseconds before the function is executed. |
| `callback` | `generic T` | `undefined` | The function to be executed after the delay.               |

## Key Features & Details

### Callback & Delay Handling

- The hook always uses the latest version of the callback, even if it changes between renders.
- The `delay` can be changed dynamically; the new delay will be used for subsequent calls.

### Returned Debounced Function

- The returned function accepts the same arguments as the original callback.
- If called repeatedly, only the last call within the delay period will trigger the callback.
- The debounced function is stable (does not change identity unless `delay` changes).

### Cleanup

- Any pending timeout is cleared when the component unmounts, preventing memory leaks or unexpected calls.

### Best Practices & Caveats

- The hook is client-side only.
- For best performance, memoize the callback if it depends on other values.
- If you need to cancel a pending debounce manually, you must manage that outside the hook.
- The hook does not guarantee the callback will run if the component unmounts before the delay.

## Examples

### Basic Usage

```tsx
const debouncedLog = useDebounceCallback((val) => {
  console.log('Debounced:', val);
}, 300);

debouncedLog('hello');
```

### With Changing Delay

```tsx
const [delay, setDelay] = useState(500);
const debouncedSave = useDebounceCallback(saveFn, delay);
```

### With Dynamic Callback

```tsx
const debounced = useDebounceCallback((...args) => {
  // Do something with args
}, 200);
```
