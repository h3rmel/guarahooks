| `ref` | `RefObject<HTMLElement> \| null` | `null`  | The ref of the element to enter/exit fullscreen. If null, uses the document. |

## Data

| Prop           | Type         | Description                                     |
| -------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `isFullscreen` | `boolean`    | Whether the element (or page) is in fullscreen. |
| `enter`        | `() => void` | Function to enter fullscreen mode.              |
| `exit`         | `() => void` | Function to exit fullscreen mode.               |

## Notes

- The hook is cross-browser compatible and uses the appropriate vendor-prefixed Fullscreen API methods.
- Only works in the browser (client-side). Ensure you use it in a client component.
- If the Fullscreen API is not available, the functions will be no-ops.

## Key Features & Details

### Cross-Browser Support

- The hook uses the appropriate vendor-prefixed Fullscreen API methods for compatibility with all major browsers.
- Listeners for fullscreen changes are also vendor-prefixed.

### Ref Behavior

- If a `ref` is provided, the hook will enter/exit fullscreen for that element.
- If `null` is passed, the hook will use the entire document (`document.documentElement`).

### State Updates & Event Handling

- The hook tracks whether the referenced element (or the page) is currently in fullscreen.
- Listens for fullscreen change events and updates state accordingly.
- The state is updated immediately on mount and whenever fullscreen changes.

### Returned Values

- Returns a tuple: `[isFullscreen, enter, exit]`.
- `isFullscreen` is `true` if the element (or page) is in fullscreen.
- `enter` and `exit` are functions to enter/exit fullscreen mode.

### Cleanup

- All event listeners are removed automatically when the component unmounts.

### Caveats & Best Practices

- Only works in the browser (client-side). On the server, the functions are no-ops.
- If the Fullscreen API is not available, the functions will be no-ops.
- The element must be in the DOM and visible to enter fullscreen.
- Some browsers may block fullscreen requests unless triggered by a user gesture.

## Examples

### Fullscreen for the Whole Page

```tsx
const [isFullscreen, enter, exit] = useFullscreen();
```

### Toggle Fullscreen

```tsx
const boxRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
const [isFullscreen, enter, exit] = useFullscreen(boxRef);

const toggle = () => {
  isFullscreen ? exit() : enter();
};
```
