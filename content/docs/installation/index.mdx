description: How to install dependencies and use the library
---

## Requirements

Use **Node.js 18** or later and install dependencies with pnpm. A `.nvmrc` file is included to match the expected Node version, and the install script checks that you have pnpm **9.15.3** or newer. If Node 18 isnâ€™t installed, run `nvm install` and then `nvm use`.

Installation works just like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/). Here's how to get started:

<Steps>

### Create project

Run the `init` command to create a new Next.js project or to set up an existing one:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest init
```

### Add components

You can now start adding components to your project.

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add "https://guarahooks.com/r/use-window-size.json"
```

### Import hook

The command above will add the `useWindowSize` hook to your project. Then you can import and use it like this:

```tsx {1,4,9,10} showLineNumbers
import { useWindowSize } from '@/hooks/guarahooks/use-window-size';

export default function Home() {
  const { width, height } = useWindowSize();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Window size</h1>
      <p>Width: {width}</p>
      <p>Height: {height}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
