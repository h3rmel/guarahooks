## July 2025 - Data Fetching hooks

We've added a new category to the guarahooks collection:

- [Data Fetching](/docs/hooks/use-fetch): Handle data fetching with different libraries.

You can check them out in the [Hooks](/docs/hooks) section.

## June 2025 - New Hooks üê∫

We've released two new hook's categories:

- [Auth](/docs/hooks/use-better-auth): Handle authentication and authorization with different providers and storage options.
- [Forms](/docs/hooks/use-react-hook-form): Handle form state and validation with different libraries.

You can check them out in the [Hooks](/docs/hooks) section.

## June 2025 - UI Improvements

We've improved the interface of the website and documentation, making it more consistent and easier to use.

The idea was to make it more minimalistic, making it more readable and focused on the content.

## May 2025 - New CLI üê∫

We've released a CLI tool to simplify the process of copying and pasting the hooks into your project. Now you don't need to depend on the `shadcn` CLI to install hooks.

You can check it out in the [CLI](/docs/cli) section, or you can see it on [npmjs here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/guara-cli).
