## July 2025 - AI Collaborative Development Workflow ü§ñ

We've introduced a revolutionary AI-powered development workflow for creating React hooks collaboratively. This system streamlines the entire hook development process from planning to implementation.

### ‚ú® New Features

- **AI-Assisted Hook Development**: Complete automation of hook creation, documentation, and integration
- **Story-Driven Development**: Technical specifications guide AI implementation
- **Automated Changelog Generation**: Implementation records are automatically created
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and testing workflows

### üìö How to Use the AI Workflow

To leverage this new collaborative development system:

1. **Read the Documentation**: Start with [`.cursor/CURSOR.MD`](https://github.com/h3rmel/guarahooks/blob/main/.cursor/CURSOR.MD) for project context and guidelines
2. **Follow the Workflow Guide**: Check [`.cursor/WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md`](https://github.com/h3rmel/guarahooks/blob/main/.cursor/WORKFLOW-GUIDE.md) for practical implementation steps
3. **Create Technical Stories**: Use the templates in `.cursor/stories/` to specify your hook requirements
4. **AI Implementation**: Submit your story for automated implementation

### üéØ Example Implementation

As a demonstration of this workflow, we've successfully implemented the **useArrayState** hook:

- **Hook**: Complete array state management with 25+ methods
- **Demo**: Interactive showcase of all functionalities
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API reference and examples
- **Category**: State Management

You can explore the complete implementation process in the [changelog](.cursor/changelog/2025-07-25-create-use-array-state-CHANGELOG.md).

## July 2025 - Data Fetching hooks

We've added a new category to the guarahooks collection:

- [Data Fetching](/docs/hooks/use-fetch): Handle data fetching with different libraries.

You can check them out in the [Hooks](/docs/hooks) section.

## June 2025 - New Hooks üê∫

We've released two new hook's categories:

- [Auth](/docs/hooks/use-better-auth): Handle authentication and authorization with different providers and storage options.
- [Forms](/docs/hooks/use-react-hook-form): Handle form state and validation with different libraries.

You can check them out in the [Hooks](/docs/hooks) section.

## June 2025 - UI Improvements

We've improved the interface of the website and documentation, making it more consistent and easier to use.

The idea was to make it more minimalistic, making it more readable and focused on the content.

## May 2025 - New CLI üê∫

We've released a CLI tool to simplify the process of copying and pasting the hooks into your project. Now you don't need to depend on the `shadcn` CLI to install hooks.

You can check it out in the [CLI](/docs/cli) section, or you can see it on [npmjs here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/guara-cli).
