## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Main Features

1. **Touch Detection Logic**: Multi-method approach for cross-browser compatibility `registry/hooks/use-is-touch-device.tsx:20-26`
   - `'ontouchstart' in window` - Standard touch event detection
   - `navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0` - Modern touch point detection
   - `navigator.msMaxTouchPoints > 0` - Legacy IE/Edge support

2. **SSR Safety**: Proper server-side rendering support with window/navigator checks `registry/hooks/use-is-touch-device.tsx:16-18`

3. **TypeScript Interface**: Well-defined return type interface `registry/hooks/use-is-touch-device.tsx:5-7`

### Code Patterns Used

- React hooks pattern with useState and useEffect
- SSR-safe implementation with browser environment checks
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Project naming conventions (kebab-case for files, camelCase for functions)

### Dependencies Added

No external dependencies required - uses only React built-in hooks.

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Validation

- ✅ Hook correctly detects touch devices (mobile, tablets)
- ✅ Hook correctly identifies non-touch devices (desktop)
- ✅ SSR compatibility verified (no hydration mismatches)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ ESLint passes without errors
- ✅ Registry builds successfully
- ✅ Documentation builds successfully
- ✅ Development server starts without issues

### Demo Implementation

Interactive demo created showing:

- Real-time touch capability detection
- Visual feedback with badges
- Clear status messaging

---

## 💻 Usage

```typescript
import { useIsTouchDevice } from "@/hooks/guarahooks/use-is-touch-device";

function Component() {
  const { isTouchable } = useIsTouchDevice();

  return (
    <div>
      {isTouchable ? (
        <button className="touch-optimized">Tap me</button>
      ) : (
        <button className="hover-optimized">Click me</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## 🚨 Notes

- Hook is categorized under "utilities" as specified in requirements
- Documentation includes comprehensive examples and API reference
- Cross-browser compatibility achieved through multiple detection methods
- Performance optimized with single useEffect and minimal re-renders
- Ready for CLI installation via `npx guara-cli@latest add use-is-touch-device`
